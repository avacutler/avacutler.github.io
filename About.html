        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Ava Cutler is a mathematician and writer, born and raised in New York City. She moved to Vienna, 
          Austria in June 2023 where she works at the at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
          At the agency she assists with yearly reports and programming. Some programming projects include a 
          ChatBot used to identify complex and unsearchable information specific to IAEA teams, improvements 
          to data manipulation software used for report production, and an online calculator to simplify access 
          to International Target Values (ITVs) based on complex variables.   </p>
          
        <p>Before the IAEA, Ava was a Software Developer and Consultant at FAST Enterprises, LLC. She 
          developed software for two state government agencies, projects that modernized the Tennessee 
          Unemployment Insurance and New Hampshire Tax systems. </p>
          
        <p>In 2021, Ava graduated from Macalester College with a degree in Mathematics and a minor in English. 
          While there, she found a passion for problem solving in many forms. In her coursework, she enjoyed writing 
          proofs and manipulating equations to produce a desired solution. After class, she tutored peers in 
          math and physics at the Macalester Academic Excellence (MAX) Center, often helping students with problems 
          she had never seen before. In her three years as a tutor, she rose to the highest student 
          position. In the second year she became a Supervisor to other tutors, and then STEM Tutor 
          Representative, overseeing other tutoring sessions and working closely with MAX Center leadership to 
          improve the tutoring Center.</p>

        <p>She studied abroad in Rabat, Morocco in 2020, a time that was abruptly cut short due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
        Still, she lived in the city for 2 months, taking courses in French, and writing articles for Morocco World News. 
        She was able to continue her writing even after returning to the United States, and continued a relationship 
          with the team throughout university.</p>

        <p>Ava has lived in 5 cities since 2020, and in each she found joy in new hobbies that connect her to the 
          place she resides. In Minnesota, she took up cross country skiing. In Rabat, she explored the local 
          cuisine. In New Hampshire, she hiked and horseback rode. In Tennessee, she explored the live music scene, 
          all while testing her tolerance to hot chicken. Now in Vienna she is studying German, skiing, and exploring 
          Austriaâ€™s variety of cultural events. </p>
